# AI Learning Journey ðŸš€

This repository documents my step-by-step learning process in Artificial Intelligence, guided by a structured weekly plan.

## ðŸ“… Study Plan
- **Duration**: ~3 months
- **Commitment**: 3â€“4 hours/week
- **Goal**: Learn AI fundamentals, explore modern AI tools, and build real-world projects (RAG, LangChain, LangGraph, Agentic AI).
